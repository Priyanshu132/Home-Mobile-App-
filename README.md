# Home (Mobile App)

Home is a multi-Hostel Management System is an Android Mobile Application in which more than one hostel can manage their system like students personal details, their fee records, mess time table etc. It also connects the warden of the hostel to all the students of hostel virtually.
It develops to remove the existing pen-paper system in the hostel like maintaining the students details, mess time table, feedback of mess, voting system of mess, attendance of students etc. Here warden can manage everything on their phone easily.
Here warden can also notify students about their late fee through message by phone and only particular student will receive this.

Here I used google firebase realtime database to store the details of students, mess time table, fee records etc.
Warden can do all the operation like update, delete,
create and read the data from database.
Students have only read the details from database and only give feedback about daily mess time table and make their attendance in front of guard providing Qr code to student.
Students also can see their seniors, juniors and batch mate along their name, branch, year and mobile number.
Students can also see the rules, hostel pictures, facilities etc and one positive thought which will change everyday with new content.
